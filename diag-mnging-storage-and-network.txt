## Diagnosing and Managing Storage and Network Issues
# Module Introduction
- Determine storage space status
- Common symptoms
- Design
- Inodes

- Identify heavy bandwidth users
- Traffic Control (tc)

# Accessing Storage Availability
df -h
lsblk
# Mount a Storage Device
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/my-usb-mount

## Addressing a Storage Crisis
- Diagnosing a Storage Problem "Read-only file system"
- Recovery - Make space
- Consider running a live USB Session - mount the full drive
  or use a GUI File Manager
- Solving the Problem
 - Upgrade hardware
 - Adopt remote storage
 - Reduce data production

ls /var/log
less /etc/logrotate.conf
less /etc/logrotate.d/ufw (ufw firewall tool)

ls /var/log/journal/
8733re39ui239239ab7y4ko5eurg
less /etc/systemd/journald.conf

## Working with Inodes
# Inode - Is an object used by Unix Systems to identify the disk
          location and attributes of files within a file system
df -i
find . -xdev -type f \
  | cut -d "/" -f 2 \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
# This will search Directories with the most Inodes

# Remove Unneeded Software Packages
# Debian / Ubuntu
apt autoremove
# RHEL / CentOS
package-cleanup

## Controlling Access to Network Bandwidth
- Using monitoring tools
- Identify heavy users
- Throttling
# Use iftop
sudo apt install iftop
sudo su
ip a

iftop -i enp0s3
# test using tmux 2nd terminal and curl https://www.pluralsight.com

nethogs enp0s3

## Traffic Control (tc)
man tc
ping www.google.co.uk
CTRL+C
tc -s qdisc ls dev enp0s3  # qdisc means queueing discipline
# add a delay
tc qdisc add dev enp0s3 root netem delay 100ms
ping www.google.co.uk  # now showing a delay of 100ms
tc qdisc del dev enp0s3 root  # reset config back to default
