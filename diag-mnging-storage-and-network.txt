ls /var/log
less /etc/logrotate.conf
less /etc/logrotate.d/ufw (ufw firewall tool)

ls /var/log/journal/

## Working with Inodes
# Inode - Is an object used by Unix Systems to identify the disk
          location and attributes of files within a file system
df -i
find . -xdev -type f \
  | cut -d "/" -f 2 \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
# This will search Directories with the most Inodes

# Remove Unneeded Software Packages
# Debian / Ubuntu
apt autoremove
# RHEL / CentOS
