## Linux Performance Monitoring and Tuning
# Commands ran within a VBox Mint Linux VM or the Win10 Dev Ubuntu Bash

## Module Introduction
cd /proc/
less cpuinfo
less cpuinfo | grep processor

## Assessing Memory Usage
# Memory Types
# Physical Memory - Random Access Memory (RAM)
# SWAP - Allocated disk space
# Disk Caching - RAM capacity "borrowed" for application use
less /proc/meminfo
free -h # compare free to available
vmstat
vmstat 1 4  # 4x 1second intervals

## Controlling Process Access to Resources
# Deprecated Process - No longer fits business needs
# Orphaned Application - Old experiment
# Unauthorized Malware
kill  # Terminates processes based on process ID
killall  # Terminates processes based on application name
